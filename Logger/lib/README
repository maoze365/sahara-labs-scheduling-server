Directory for Scheduling Server Logger libraries. The required library is:

  - log4j - Log4J (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html)
            Logging library which outputs log statements to a variety of 
            output targets. Tested with version version 1.2.15. 
            NOTE: The name of the log4j Jar library is hard coded 
            in the bundle bnd file so the properties 'Bundle-ClassPath'
            and 'Include-Resource' must be modified to specify the correct
            log4j file.
