<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Brief description:</h3>
The diagnostics page displays information about the running Scheduling Server. This
is to help diagnose potential problems and investigate error conditions. The 
diagnostics displayed on this page is automatically updated every 10
seconds.

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Runtime information:</h3>
The information shown on this tab is about the execution of the Scheduling Server.
The information fields are:
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Name</span> - The runtime name of the Java virtual
	machine. The exact name format is virtual machine specific but is usually
	composed of &lt;Process PID&gt;@&lt;Computer hostname&gt;.</li>

	was started.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Uptime</span> - How long the Scheduling Server has been
	running in terms of days, hours, minutes and seconds.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Working directory</span> - The current / working
	directory (CWD) of the Scheduling Server which is the base path of relative file paths.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span> The working directory is extremely
		important as the configuration files are loaded relative to it. 
	</div>
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The Scheduling Server service sets the working
		directory to the installation directory of the Scheduling Server.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Class path</span> - The list of directories and Jar
	files where classes are loaded from. Any class path location starting with

	Jar	files where the Java classes are loaded.</li>

	configuration system (i.e. configuration files).</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Environment variables</span> - The environment

</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>System</h3>
The information shown on this tab displays memory being used by the Scheduling Server

	<li><span class='bold'>Max memory</span> - Max memory shows the amount of
	memory that can be assigned to the Scheduling Server by the operating system if it
	is needed.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Current threads</span> - Shows the number of currently 
	active threads.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Daemon threads</span> - Daemon threads do not keep
	the Java virtual machine running (i.e. when all threads are daemon threads,
	the Scheduling Server terminates).</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Peak threads</span> - The highest number of
	concurrent threads that have been running.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Total started threads</span> - The total number of

		<li>Thread unique identifier.</li>
		<li>Thread name.</li>
		<li>Thread state.</li>
		<li>Thread CPU time, rather how long the thread has been in the 
		runnable state.</li>
		<li>Thread stack trace. This shows the currently executing method at the
		top of the stack and the list of method invocations that from thread start
		got to the current method.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 class='helptitle ui-widget-header ui-corner-all'>Java</h3>
The information show on this tab displays Java virtual machine details.
<ul>
	<li><span class='bold'>Virtual machine</span> - The name of the
	virtual machine.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> Java usually comes with a few virtual
		machine implementations including 'Client' and 'Server' (the virtual
		machine name will specifies this). It is recommended to use the 'Server'
		virtual machine which trades memory and startup time for better 
		performance. This may be configured in the Scheduling Server service INI file 
		by setting the path of the virtual machine implementation library.
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>version</span> - The Java virtual machine version.
	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE:</span>The minimum required version is '1.6.x', 
		also known as Java 6 (this might be displayed as 16.x). Earlier 
		versions of Java are unsupported and probably will not work.

	<div class='ui-state ui-state-error ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-alert helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>NOTE: </span>On Linux 64bit architectures (displayed

	available to the Java virtual machine.</li>
	<li><span class='bold'>File separator</span> - The separator between

	<div class='ui-state ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all helphint'>
		<span class='ui-icon ui-icon-info helphinticon'> </span>
		<span class='bold'>HINT:</span> The separtor '/' works on both
		UNIX and Windows and should be used Windows instead of the displayed
		character '\'. The '\' character is used as the special character
		escape character, so if '\' is used, it should be escaped using
		'\' (i.e. C:\\foo\\bar\\baz).
	</div></li>
	<li><span class='bold'>Path separator</span> - The character delimiting 
	file paths in the Scheduling Servers class path and library path. This is
