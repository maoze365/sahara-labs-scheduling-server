  - PMD       - PMD (http://pmd.sourceforge.net/). Tested with version 4.2.5.
                PMD scans Java source code and looks for potential problems like:
                  * Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
                  * Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and private methods
                  * Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
                  * Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements, 
                    for loops that could be while loops
                  * Duplicate code - copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs
